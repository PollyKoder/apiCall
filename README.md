# NOTE

The page seems to be ok now visually, after some troubleshooting, but the data from the API is still not being pushed to the page itself. It gives the information from the API in the console log, but only gives "undefined" in the divCard on the page itself. I've requested help from teacher and class mates, have not received reply from teacher and classmates who have tried to help cannot seem to find the error either.

A class mate used chatGPT(sidenote, yes I have tried to use chatGPT, but it does not work and only gives error whenever I write something), and I have copy, pasted the code to test if it works. As noted above the code from chatGPT that is now commented out; it does work, but only gives one value from the API, when I would like it to collect values/quotes at random.

Got another chatGPT code from  a classmate, this one does work as intended... Not satisfied with why I could not get my own code to work though.


css note: I see that the button could be styled better, it does do it job, but there is no visible respnse when the button is clicked unlike previous pages I coded.
Also I've spent so much time trying to figure out why the API would not play along that I don't remember why I made space for a banner/header on top of the page, as of now it only adds to aesthetics and nothing else.
